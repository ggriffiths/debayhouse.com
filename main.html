<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<br>
	<p>While you're enjoying this lovely home, you can stroll the peaceful, clean Broadkill beaches for
	miles or soak up sun as your children play in the shallow water. When you've had enough sun,
	you can nap to the hypnotic lull of waves. With its wraparound decks, you can take your coffee
	on the east deck tower with a view for miles, sun and grill on the south deck, and sip cocktails
	on the west deck watching the sun set. At night, you'll want to watch the romantic moonrise
	over the Delaware Bay. With vacant lots and dense trees on both sides of the house, your
	privacy is complete in this recently renovated gem.
	<br><br>
	
	There's never enough time to enjoy the beach, so be sure you reserve the house for 
	summer!</p>
